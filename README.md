# Bookstore App (React and Redux)

This project is one of the Main React and Redux curriculum projects at [Microverse](https://https://www.microverse.org/) - @microverseinc

The objective is to create a simple bookstore app using React and Redux. This application is integrated with an external API. The API was created with Rails and it's hosted on heroku. All changes made in this app are saved in the external API. The app features include:

- Create book.
- Edit book.
- Update book progress.
- Delete book.
- Filter book by category.
